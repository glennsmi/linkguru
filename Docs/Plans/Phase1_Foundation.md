# Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)

## Overview
Establish the core infrastructure, authentication, and basic link functionality to create a working prototype that demonstrates the core value proposition.

## Goals
- Working multi-tenant authentication system
- Basic link creation and redirect functionality
- Data model implementation with proper tenant isolation
- Simple QR code generation
- Minimal but functional UI

## Detailed Tasks

### Week 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure

#### Firebase Setup
- [ ] Create Firebase project with Functions v2 enabled
- [ ] Configure Firestore database with multi-region setup
- [ ] Set up Firebase Hosting with custom domain routing
- [ ] Configure Firebase Auth with email/password and Google providers
- [ ] Set up Firebase Functions v2 with Europe West 2 region
- [ ] Initialize Firestore security rules for tenant isolation

#### Development Environment
- [ ] Set up local development environment (Node.js, npm, Firebase CLI)
- [ ] Configure TypeScript compilation for Functions
- [ ] Set up shared TypeScript library for schemas and types
- [ ] Configure Ionic React project with proper routing
- [ ] Set up development database with test data

#### CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] Configure Firebase deployment scripts
- [ ] Set up automated testing framework (Jest)
- [ ] Configure linting and code formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Set up basic monitoring and error tracking

### Week 2: Authentication & Multi-tenancy

#### User Authentication
- [ ] Implement Firebase Auth integration in React app
- [ ] Create login/signup forms with email/password
- [ ] Add Google Sign-in integration
- [ ] Implement protected routes and auth guards
- [ ] Create user profile management

#### Tenant Management
- [ ] Design and implement tenant data model
- [ ] Create tenant creation flow for new users
- [ ] Implement tenant switching functionality
- [ ] Set up basic role system (Owner, Admin, Member)
- [ ] Create tenant invitation system foundation

#### Data Model Implementation
- [ ] Implement Firestore collections structure:
  - `/tenants/{tenantId}`
  - `/tenants/{tenantId}/members/{uid}`
  - `/tenants/{tenantId}/links/{linkId}`
  - `/tenants/{tenantId}/links/{linkId}/clicks/{eventId}`
- [ ] Create Firestore security rules for tenant isolation
- [ ] Implement composite indexes for efficient queries
- [ ] Set up data validation and sanitization

### Week 3: Core Link Functionality

#### Link Creation API
- [ ] Implement `POST /createShortLink` Cloud Function
- [ ] Add URL validation (format and accessibility checks)
- [ ] Generate unique short IDs with collision handling
- [ ] Implement basic link document creation
- [ ] Add tenant-scoped link storage

#### Redirect System
- [ ] Implement `GET /r/:shortId` redirect endpoint
- [ ] Set up Firebase Hosting rewrites for short domain
- [ ] Add 302 redirect logic with fallback handling
- [ ] Implement basic click event logging
- [ ] Add expired/invalid link handling

#### Basic QR Generation
- [ ] Implement `GET /qr/:shortId.png` endpoint
- [ ] Set up QR code generation library (`qrcode` npm package)
- [ ] Add basic PNG generation with default settings
- [ ] Implement CDN caching headers for QR images
- [ ] Add error handling for invalid short IDs

#### Minimal UI Implementation
- [ ] Create basic Ionic React layout with navigation
- [ ] Implement link creation form (URL input only)
- [ ] Add link list display with basic information
- [ ] Create tenant switcher component
- [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile-first approach

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Users can sign up and log in with email/password or Google
- ✅ New users are automatically assigned to a tenant
- ✅ Users can create short links from valid URLs
- ✅ Short links redirect correctly to destination URLs
- ✅ Basic QR codes generate in PNG format
- ✅ Links are properly isolated by tenant

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Redirect latency < 200ms (local testing)
- ✅ Firestore security rules prevent cross-tenant access
- ✅ QR images cache properly with appropriate headers
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ Code follows TypeScript best practices

### Quality Requirements
- ✅ Unit test coverage > 70% for core functions
- ✅ No critical linting errors
- ✅ Basic error handling for common failure modes
- ✅ Clean, responsive UI that works on mobile

## Deliverables
- Working prototype with core functionality
- Deployed Firebase Functions and Hosting
- Basic UI for link creation and management
- Comprehensive test suite for core features
- Documentation for setup and deployment

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Firebase configuration complexity:** Mitigated by following official documentation and starting with minimal configuration
- **Multi-tenant security issues:** Mitigated by implementing security rules early and thorough testing
- **Performance bottlenecks:** Mitigated by implementing basic monitoring and load testing

## Dependencies
- Firebase project with billing enabled
- Custom domain for short links (can use Firebase default initially)
- Development team with Firebase and React experience

## Next Phase Preparation
- Review user feedback on prototype
- Performance testing results
- Security audit of data model
- UI/UX feedback for improvement areas
