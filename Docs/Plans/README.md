# Link Guru - Execution Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive execution plan for building Link Guru, a multi-tenant link shortening platform with UTM builder and QR code generation capabilities. The plan is based on the improved PRD and structured around four main phases with detailed milestones and success criteria.

## Key Objectives

- **Adoption:** 100 active tenants, 1,000 total links within 3 months
- **Engagement:** 80% of users create >1 link per month, 60% use UTM builder
- **Technical:** 99.9% uptime, <150ms p95 redirect latency
- **Business:** Strong foundation for v2 monetization

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Ionic React with TypeScript
- **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Functions v2, Hosting)
- **Analytics:** Vega for client-side visualization
- **QR Generation:** Server-side via Cloud Functions with caching
- **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting with custom domain routing

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-3)
**Goal:** Establish core infrastructure and basic functionality

- Multi-tenant authentication and data model
- Basic link creation and redirect system
- Simple QR generation (PNG only)
- Minimal UI for core flows

**Success Criteria:**
- Working short links with redirects
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Basic QR code generation
- <200ms redirect latency

### Phase 2: MVP Core Features (Weeks 4-6)
**Goal:** Production-ready feature set

- UTM builder with validation and preview
- Enhanced QR options (SVG, sizing, presets)
- Click analytics with Vega charts
- Team management and invitations
- Link management interface
- Free tier limits enforcement

**Success Criteria:**
- Full UTM parameter support with validation
- Working analytics dashboard
- Team collaboration features
- Enforced free tier limits (5 active links)

### Phase 3: Polish & Scale (Weeks 7-8)
**Goal:** Production hardening and optimization

- Performance tuning and monitoring
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting and abuse protection
- User onboarding optimization
- Security hardening (App Check, rate limits)

**Success Criteria:**
- p95 < 150ms redirect latency
- 99.9% uptime target
- Robust error handling
- Clean user experience

### Phase 4: V1 Enhancements (Weeks 9-12)
**Goal:** Value-added features for retention

- PDF QR export functionality
- Advanced link management (tags, search, bulk operations)
- Enhanced analytics (device breakdown, geographic data)
- Email templates and link sharing
- Link expiration and advanced status management

**Success Criteria:**
- High user engagement metrics
- Clear upgrade value proposition
- Strong retention (80% monthly active tenants)
- Foundation for monetization

## Critical Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Firebase project setup with Functions v2
- Custom domain configuration for redirects
- Firestore security rules implementation
- CDN configuration for QR image caching

### External Dependencies
- Domain registration and DNS setup
- SSL certificate configuration
- Firebase billing account for production scaling

## Risk Mitigation

See [Risk_Mitigation.md](Risk_Mitigation.md) for detailed risk assessment and mitigation strategies covering:
- Performance risks (viral link traffic spikes)
- Security risks (abuse for spam/phishing)
- Data loss risks (Firestore limitations)
- Product risks (market competition, adoption challenges)

## Success Metrics

See [Success_Metrics.md](Success_Metrics.md) for detailed KPIs and measurement strategies covering:
- Product metrics (adoption, engagement, technical performance)
- Business metrics (revenue indicators, quality metrics)
- Launch success criteria by timeframe

## Resource Requirements

### Development Team
- 1-2 Full-stack developers
- 1 UI/UX designer (contract)
- 1 DevOps engineer (part-time)

### Infrastructure Budget
- Firebase Functions: ~$10-50/month (depending on usage)
- Firebase Hosting: ~$5/month
- Firestore: ~$10-100/month (depending on data volume)
- Custom domain: ~$15/year

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this execution plan
2. Set up development environment (Phase 1)
3. Begin foundation implementation
4. Regular progress reviews and adjustments

## Decision Log

- **Tech Stack:** Firebase ecosystem approved for rapid development and scalability
- **Architecture:** Multi-tenant model with tenant-scoped Firestore paths
- **Auth:** Firebase Auth with email/password + Google Sign-in
- **QR Formats:** PNG/SVG for MVP, PDF for v1
- **Analytics:** Vega for client-side visualization, Firestore for data storage
- **Limits:** Free tier capped at 5 active links per tenant
