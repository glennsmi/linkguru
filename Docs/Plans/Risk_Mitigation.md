- Fast execution and frequent releases
- Customer feedback integration for feature prioritization
- Build strong brand and community
- Monitor competitor developments closely

#### Risk: Platform changes (Firebase pricing, policy changes)
**Impact:** Increased costs, feature limitations
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Monitor Firebase roadmap and pricing announcements
- Design with vendor lock-in minimization
- Maintain alternative implementation options
- Build abstraction layers for key services
- Regular cost-benefit analysis of platform choices

## Operational Risks

### Medium Impact - Team and Process

#### Risk: Scope creep and feature bloat
**Impact:** Delayed launch, reduced quality
**Probability:** High
**Mitigation:**
- Strict prioritization based on user research
- Time-boxed development sprints
- Regular stakeholder reviews and adjustments
- Clear definition of MVP vs. nice-to-have features
- User story mapping and MoSCoW prioritization

#### Risk: Key team member departure
**Impact:** Knowledge loss, development delays
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive documentation of all systems
- Cross-training of team members
- Code review and knowledge sharing practices
- Critical system documentation and runbooks
- Overlap periods for knowledge transfer

### Low Impact - External Dependencies

#### Risk: Third-party service outages
**Impact:** Partial system unavailability
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Implement circuit breaker patterns
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- Multiple fallback options where possible
- Service level monitoring and alerting
- Incident response procedures

#### Risk: Domain or DNS issues
**Impact:** Broken redirects, user confusion
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Domain registration with multiple providers
- DNS redundancy and failover setup
- Monitoring of domain expiration dates
- Clear communication channels for DNS changes
- Backup domain options

## Security Risks

### High Impact - Data Protection

#### Risk: Privacy regulation non-compliance (GDPR)
**Impact:** Legal penalties, reputational damage
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- IP address hashing for all stored data
- Clear privacy policy and data usage documentation
- User data export and deletion capabilities
- Regular privacy audit and compliance review
- Data retention policies with automatic cleanup

#### Risk: Abuse for spam or phishing
**Impact:** Platform blacklisting, legal issues
**Probability:** Medium
**Mitigation:**
- URL validation and scanning for malicious content
- Rate limiting and abuse detection
- User reporting system for suspicious links
- Integration with abuse databases
- Clear terms of service and enforcement

### Medium Impact - Authentication

#### Risk: Authentication system vulnerabilities
**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches
**Probability:** Low
**Mitigation:**
- Firebase Auth security best practices
- Multi-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Regular security updates and patches
- Session management and timeout policies
- Security monitoring and anomaly detection

## Business Risks
